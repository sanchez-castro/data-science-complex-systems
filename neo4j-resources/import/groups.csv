<p>Update (05/11): We have finished the Udacity course on Deep Learning and moving forward we have decided to focus on lectures as well as the ongoing research in the area of Deep Learning.

<p>We may not have very much potable drinking water out here, but we do have a lot of talented, creative, entrepreneurial, and engineering-minded hacktivists — and if we all combine our unique skills and talents together we can develop some innovative solutions.</p>
<p>The idea of this movement is to Hack the Drought. This is a hackathon combined with a project-based approach to providing real solutions to some of the most pressing problems facing water officials, farmers, and all of us. Hack the Drought meetups are being concurrently organized in major Western cities in order to rally the region’s best and brightest to approach the problem from new perspectives.</p>
<p>Water is the most fundamental human right we all share, and we need to take creative, collective, and proactive steps to work towards solutions instead of just sitting around pretending like it will all be okay.

These are all going to be targeted to experienced software engineers who just want to learn more about machine intelligence. In all of this, we're assuming that you probably know how to read software manuals, but the barrier to understanding state of the art machine learning is just a bit higher than is easy to pull off on evenings and weekends. So we'll focus on helping you to develop intuition and a good, solid understanding of the basics as well as enough software to help you keep going when you get home (or back to work). In other words, we'll help you decide what to do next.</p>
<p>In the process, we'd like to help people get to know each other.</p>

We commonly have core sessions for beginners on EC2, S3 and RDS and we have three different types of MeetUps:</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>Type 1: Sharing what we know</p>
<p>We do this for materials that we completely understand and want to share with others.&nbsp;<span>For example, Glen Jarvis have been using EC2 professionally for over 4 years. He has plenty of experience with EC2. &nbsp;Here is a sample video that shows how to get up and running with EC2 from scratch:</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmNgXQXkpWs"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmNgXQXkpWs</a></p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>Type 2. Learning by Teaching</p>
<p>There are often topics that we mostly understand but not polished enough to do as a ""Sharing what we know"" session. This is perfect for someone who wants to give a talk but doesn't yet understand the materials 100%. When one read/learns to present, the level of learning is much higher than if they were just reading for themselves.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that you you understood S3 fairly well and you knew the theory of how to make CloudFront make a static webpage. But, imagine you didn't quite know how to make it work, but you were really curious and it was a personal challenge. If you volunteered to give the next talk on how to set-up CloudFront and S3 to be a static webpage, it would be a great way to dig deep and share what you learned.</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>3. Skunk-work Hack-a-thons&nbsp;</p>
<p>These MeetUps are typically a lot longer (most of the day instead of just an hour or so). They are for topics that are not known to the group. There are a LOT of Amazon Web Services after all -- and they keep growing. In these MeetUps we break into teams, try to absorb what we can from the docs and experimentation and then we have 'show-and-tell' for what we learned in the day wrap-up.</p>","Glen Jarvis, LLC Business Accnt",198162358

<p><b>Does The Hyperledger Project have the potential to become the engine behind most successful decentralized applications and organizations created in the next 25-50 years? Absolutely! </b></p>
<p>A much better question is how, and in what new ways, can we: </p>
<p>a) Build decentralized applications, organizations and APIs at 10x the speed at 1/10 the cost.</p>
<p>b) Build situational awareness in the local community.</p>
<p>I believe that the convergence of decentralized applications, decentralized organizations, artificial intelligence and IoT brings upon us the Great Displacement of the 21st century, where the majority of workforce will be left without “conventional” jobs, forced to learn new skills and professions. </p>
<p><b>Why? </b></p>
<p>Founders of this group believe that the Hyperledger Foundation will be the engine behind decentralization of the world, a massive economic change of the next 25-50 years. </p>
<p>So.... why don't we standardize and democratize the field with and around Hyperledger? </p>
<p><b>What? </b></p>
<p>We are a local micro community of those interested in advancing their knowledge of Hyperledger, its use cases and applications. </p>
<p><b>How? </b></p>
<p>Join our group for a regular dose of human interaction, conversations, smiles, food and drinks on all things Hyperledger: </p>
<p>• Use Cases</p>
<p>• Competitive analysis of Hyperledger startups (Distributed Apps from disruptive companies in specific vertical markets)</p>
<p>• How-To’s </p>
<p>• Interviews with individuals working at the edge of the Hyperledger project</p>
<p>• Reviews of tools, services and APIs offered by the Hyperledger ecosystem</p>
<p>• Best Practices in Application Architecture</p>
<p>• Do’s and Don’ts </p>
<p>• Application Templates</p>
<p>• Hackathons</p>
<p>• Security in the decentralized world - on the edge, on the node, in the cloud and in transit</p>
<p>• How others solve some of the hard problems that exist in the world using Hyperledger.</p>

<p>""Symfony is a full-stack framework, a library of cohesive classes written in PHP.</p>
<p>It provides an architecture, components and tools for developers to build complex web applications faster. Choosing symfony allows you to release your applications earlier, host and scale them without problem, and maintain them over time with no surprise.</p>
<p>Symfony is based on experience. It does not reinvent the wheel: it uses most of the best practices of web development and integrates some great third-party libraries.</p>
<p>Thousands of developers already trust symfony for their applications!</p>
<p>New users join the community every day, and that makes of symfony the most popular PHP framework around. A large community means easy-to-find support, user-contributed documentation, plugins, and free applications.""</p>","Damien Filiatrault",2017753
